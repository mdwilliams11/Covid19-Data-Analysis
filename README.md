# Module 20 Individual Self Assessment

### Self-Assessment

For our final project we faced a lot of trouble finding a usable dataset that we would allow us to run perform machine learning models. I finally found a patient-level dataset published by the Mexican government. 
I did a lot of the initial exploratory analysis with python and some tableau visualizations to make sure the data made sense and was usable. As the project went on I mostly worked with the exploratory and visualization elements.
I wanted to get more practice with Tableau so I ended up doing a lot of the visualizations that would be used in our final dashboard. Throughout the project I kept up to date with what everyone else was doing and tried to replicate it myself in order to check that it was working and to get more practice with the database and machine learning elements.
The hardest part of the project was deciding which parts of the data to focus on and what sort of story that would translate to for our presentation. The dataset we worked with had a lot of useful features and we spent a lot of time trying to define what we wanted to focus on. 
We had to spend a lot of time meeting with each other and presenting what we thought we should be focusing on before our project started to come together with a more focused approach.


### Team Assessment

Our team did a wonderful job communicating where were at during each segment of the project. We met as a group about twice a week in addition to the two lectures in order to discuss what we had done and what still needed to be done.
In addition to zoom meetings we frequently updated shared documents in slack, google slides, a test github repository, and of course our main project github repository. The test repository was used as practice for using github as a team and for extra documents links we didn't want cluttering the main repository.
Sometimes it was difficult to remain productive during meetings due to there being 6 of us, especially early in the project when we were still trying to define what our overall hypothesis and story was going to be.


### Summary of Project

Our project looked at the relationship between certain pre-existing health conditions of Covid-positive patients and the resulting severity of their Covid case.
We created machine learning models which predicts the expected outcome of whether a patient lived or died and whether they would require intubation or ICU resources based on their underlying pre-existing conditions.
The models achieved a predictive accuracy of 88% and highlighted the top predictive features.
